# NBA Game

NBA East & West conference ranking game.

## Game rules

I want to create a NBA game where each player has to predict the standings in both the eastern and western conference.

We award points for accuracy ranges:

- Exact position = 5 pts
- Within 1 spot = 3 pts
- Within 2 spots = 1 pt
- More than 2 off = 0 pts

The winner is the player with the highest amount of points.
